# Agora — website

The launch site for **Agora**, the new town square for free speech.
A human-first digital public square: zero ads, absolute chronology, strict
moderation of harm.

Pure **vanilla HTML / CSS / JS** — no frameworks, no build step. Serve the repository root locally to resolve root-absolute asset URLs.

## Pages

| File               | Purpose                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index.html`       | Home — hero, motive/philosophy, CTAs                                    |
| `shared-post.html` | Landing for shared post links (WhatsApp, etc.) when the app is not installed. Parses `?post=` / `?post_id=` / `?id=` and renders a preview stub until the backend is connected |
| `download.html`    | APK download, system requirements, version details, 3-step install guide |
| `about.html`       | Vision, Jayvardhan Bhaskar's creator bio, and the live feedback form     |
| `credits.html`     | Fixed-screen rotary team credits with synchronized off-screen discs and a pendulum role sign |

Shared assets:

| File               | Purpose                                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `style.css`        | Mobile-first design system for all pages           |
| `app.js`           | Routing, mobile menu, smooth scroll, reveals, feedback form, shared-post preview |
| `app-beta-v2.0.apk`   | Legacy local APK; download buttons now use the GitHub release |
| `assets/agora-logo.svg`      | Logo / tab icon                                    |
| `assets/`          | App screenshots shown in the phone frames — see `assets/README.md` for the exact filenames to replace |

## Run locally

No build needed. Serve the folder from its root:

```bash
npm run dev          # python3 http.server on http://localhost:5173
# or
python3 -m http.server 5173
```

Useful local URLs:

- `http://localhost:5173/`
- `http://localhost:5173/shared-post.html?post=a8f3c2`  ← shared-link flow
- `http://localhost:5173/download.html`
- `http://localhost:5173/about.html`

## Deploy

The repository root **is** the static site. Point any static host
(Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, S3+CloudFront…) at the root and
keep `_redirects` / `robots.txt` in place. To test a shared link on a
custom domain, share e.g. `https://your-domain/shared-post.html?post=<id>`.

## Wiring up the backend

- `initSharedPost()` — `fetchPost(id)` is a stub returning a simulated
  payload after a delay. Replace with `GET /api/v1/posts/:id` when the API is live.
- `functions/api/contact.js` — Cloudflare Pages Function used by the About-page
  feedback form. It validates JSON or FormData, escapes the submitted values,
  and sends the message through Resend to `mail@agora.in.net`.
- Set `RESEND_API_KEY` as a Cloudflare Pages environment variable (and as a
  local secret when using `wrangler pages dev`). Never put the key in `app.js`
  or any browser-delivered file. The browser posts to `/api/contact`, shows
  `Sending...` while the request is in flight, and reveals the inline
  `Signal received` panel on a successful JSON response.

  A hidden honeypot field absorbs bots, and `SUBMIT_TIMEOUT` (12s) keeps a
  slow API request from hanging the button.

## Asset paths

All CSS/JS/image/page links are **root-absolute** (`/style.css`, `/app.js`,
`/assets/…`, `/download.html`). This is deliberate: shared links arrive with
query strings and sometimes nested paths (`/post/abc123`), and relative
paths would resolve against that path, break, and get swallowed by the
`_redirects` catch-all. Because of this, serve the site from the **domain
root** (not a sub-folder) — `python3 -m http.server` from this folder does
exactly that. Opening `index.html` via `file://` will no longer resolve the
assets; use the local server instead.

## Responsive breakpoints (`style.css`)

Mobile-first base styles, then: `≤480px` phone, `≤768px` tablet (hamburger
nav), `≥769px` desktop nav, `≥1024px` wide layouts.

## Notes

- The feedback form on `about.html` uses the same-origin `/api/contact`
  Cloudflare Pages Function and Resend. Keep `RESEND_API_KEY` server-side; the
  direct email link below the form remains available as a human fallback.
- Brand lockup: the header and footer render the app-style mark **plus** the
  lowercase `agora.` wordmark (`.nav__logo-name` in `style.css`), including the
  violet period used inside the app. The same lockup is shared across every
  page; `shared-post.html`'s slim footer uses the `.nav__logo--compact` variant
  so it stays compact without changing the brand treatment.
- UI palette: deep dark surfaces, glass panels, and violet-to-blue gradient
  pill-shaped primary buttons with dark text for readable contrast. The same
  gradient carries the period in the `agora.` lockup, while the wordmark fades
  from full brightness on the left to roughly 74% visibility on the right.
  Original logo artwork is centralized at `/assets/agora-logo.svg` for
  replacement with the final approved export.
- Ambient interaction uses `/assets/bgMusic.mpeg` as a softly filtered, low-volume
  looping background track. The page attempts autoplay and falls back to the first
  user gesture when the browser blocks autoplay; the visible dot-matrix mesh breathes
  with the track. The custom cursor is limited to fine pointers and is disabled for
  reduced motion.
- `about.html` names Jayvardhan Bhaskar as the app and website developer and shares
  his motivation. The portrait is stored at `/assets/developer.png`; the avatar
  reserves space and shows a fallback if the image cannot load.
- `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json` are unused legacy scaffold configuration.

## Launch handoff & validation

See [`assets/README.md`](assets/README.md) for the exact **3 screenshot files**
that fill all **6 placements**, logo replacement instructions, and APK handoff.
Old generated screenshot stand-ins have been removed; their frames remain and
show a pending message until real captures are uploaded. Do not add device frames.

All contact links use `mail@agora.in.net`. Exploratory CTAs say **Get the app**;
only the direct release action on `download.html` uses **Download APK**. Main-page navigation leads to the
download page, while direct APK links use the [v2.0-beta GitHub release](https://github.com/JayBhaskarCoding/agora-android/releases/download/v2.0-beta/app-beta-v2.0.apk).
This update does not certify a final release.

```bash
npm test             # dependency-free HTML/asset/theme contract tests
node --check app.js  # JavaScript syntax validation
```

## Navigation and shared links

- “Why Agora” targets `/index.html#why-agora` (a local fragment on home).
  Its 5rem scroll margin keeps the fixed header clear of the section.
  Smooth scrolling honors reduced-motion preferences.
- `shared-post.html` is an external deep-link entrypoint, not a marketing page.
  No standard navigation or download-page buttons link to it; it is also marked
  `noindex, follow`. Existing `/post/:id` and `/p/:id` deployment rewrites remain.
  This isolates navigation, not access: anyone with a valid URL can open it.
- About values use scoped crimson/emerald accents. Other UI accents remain violet.
